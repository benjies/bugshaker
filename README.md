## Ticket System
- The ticket system provides an easy to read layout by using CSS Display Grid
- This ensures each and every ticket will have the data in the same spot everytime

## Overview System
- In order to support the ticket system, the overview section provides a quick glance at the total status of all the bugs in the system
- Built to last, with each function in bugshaker, dynamic updates happen everytime a new entry is added, updated, or deleted so you never have to worry if your data is outdated

## Challenges
- I struggled in the beginning to properly log a ticket as I have never used Firebase's realtime database before. However, within a few hours, I was able to not only understand the documents but be able to implement it
- React had some syntax changes that I was unaware of. It was easy to fix with a quick Google search into the documentation, but it taught me the significance of updating versions without first understanding what was actually changing
- React State was something I thought I understood. However, in the beginning I was not using it by passing it top-down, but rather trying to do everything in the child element. I have a better understanding of React as a whole plus the useState() hook.
